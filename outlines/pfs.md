        - Review the case for ubiquitous transport security
        - Discuss key exchange and service centric sessions
        - Discuss what’s between session transport keys and long-lived public/private key pairs.
        - Open question: we need for a dynamic multiparty group key exchange protocol

                - name-based networking
            - Question #1: Does ICN require ubiquitous transport encryption?
        - Issue #2: Forward secrecy
            - Modern transport secure communication protocols have several desirable properties:
                - Forward secrecy (define)
                - Deniability (define)
                - ...
            - Today’s ICN architectures have long-lived public keys
            - Existing works for confidentiality *do not have forward secrecy*
                - Cite all of the papers and state why not
                    - No handshake, basically
            - What’s the difference between IP protocols and ICN approaches?
                - Key lifetime and window of compromise
                - Sessions: lifetime and window is that of the session
                - ICN: lifetime and window is basically infinite
                - **Draw the spectrum (sessions on left, ICN on right)
                    - Farther we go to the left the closer we get to host-based networking
                    - Farther we go to the right the closer we get to information-centric networking
            - Lifetime spectrum of transport keys
                - Why?
                    - We want to minimize content exposure but also want to increase caching utilization
                - What is the middle ground?
                    - Who owns the keys?
                    - How are they used? What do they protect?
                - Thought experiment:
                    - Draw the spanning tree from the producer to consumers (top-down)
                    - Imagine we had a group key exchange protocol that existed between adjacent peers in an ICN network
                        - 1-n between a router and its downstream consumers/routers
                        - Assume that the protocol was such that each key was updated whenever the lifetime window rolled over
                    - Imagine that the lifetime of each link key became smaller and smaller the further away from the producer
                        - Draw a top-down picture that shows the lifetime window of data being transported (see notebook)
                    - Assume that content was still encrypted end-to-end so that transport key exposure doesn’t compromise the data
                    - What would this give us?
                        - Longer cache lifetimes upstream with wider exposure windows
                            - But! Exposure doesn’t threaten privacy of individual consumers since the anonymity set is naturally larger
                        - Small (even session-based) windows at the edge
                            - Exposure is minimized
                    - How can we build this protocol?

    - Slide outline:
        - Different types of privacy-relevant attacks in interest-based ICNs
            - Correlation of data across consumers
                - TODO: explain why this is bad
            - Content leakage through request names
                - TODO: explain why this is bad
                - TODO: explain what IP parity means
        - Adversary model
            - (IDENTIFICATION) Adv who tries to learn the destination
                - Winning criteria: Given an interest from Cr_i, R cannot learn that Cr_i sent an interest to P_i with probability non-negligibly better than 1/2.
            - (CORRELATION) Adv who tries to correlate
                - Winning criteria: Given two interest and data packet pairs for the same application data, R cannot decide if they correspond to the same bits with probability non-negligibly better than 1/2.
        - Question: what does it take to prevent both of these attacks?
        - Identification thought experiment
            - Assumptions
                - Hard: Packet forwarding is deterministic and correct (no notion of probabilistic forwarding)
                - Hard: Forwarding a packet is a non-interactive procedure (consumer sends one thing and that’s it)
                - Hard: Packet forwarding must be efficient
                - Hard: There exists some function f() that is used by consumers to translate application names to network names.
                    - In vanilla CCN, f() is the identity function
                - Soft: Consumers, router, and producers have the same knowledge
                    - Application data namespace is known
                    - Public keying information
                    - f() is public, but the inputs might be private (only known to the consumers and producers)
                - Soft: Content popularity is known
                - Soft: Forwarding uses LPM lookup and exact match
            - Case 1: keep all assumptions
                - For any interest for name N', R can guess N and check that N’ = f(N)
                - Morale: vanilla CCN is bad
            - Case 2: Consumers and producer share a secret
                - Let fk() be the translation function
                - Let N’ = fk(N) must be what’s in the FIB, by properties of LPM and exact match
                - Assume content from P1 is more popular than content from P2 (more interests have fk(P1) prefix than fk(P2) prefix)
                - Then, R can distinguish between P1 and P2 interests through aux. information
                - Morale: application data namespace information cannot be in the network
            - Case 3: FIB uses LPM but *not* exact match
                - (see notebook)
        - Correlation thought experiment
            - Assumptions:
                - Same as above
            - Case 1: keep all assumptions
                - Any two identical interests will yield identical data. Done.
                - Morale: Correlation is effortless in vanilla CCN
            - Case 2: interests have consumer-specific information and the data responses are not equivalent
                - If consumer-specific information leaks no information about the data, then correlation is not possible
                - Otherwise, R can correlate
                - Morale: consumer-specific encryption (e.g., through sessions) is needed
        - Look forward
            - Privacy principles (present them in the list)

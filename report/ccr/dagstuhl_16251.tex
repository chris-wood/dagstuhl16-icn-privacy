\begin{abstract}
In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from
both academic and industry participants. ICN offers a data-centric inter-networking
that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and privacy issues
in ICN have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures for
real-world deployment. Security and privacy features on today's Internet
were originally not present and have been incrementally retrofitted
over the last 35 years. ICN-based architectures
(e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore
ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques.

This report documents the program and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251
on ``Information-centric Networking and Security.'' The goal was to bring together
researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based
architectures. Attendees represented diverse areas of expertise, including: networking,
security, privacy, software engineering, and formal methods. Through presentations and
focused working groups, attendees identified and discussed issues relevant to security
and privacy, and charted paths for their mitigation and future work.

\section{Introduction}
Dagstuhl seminar 16251 on ``Information-centric Networking and Security'' was a three-day
workshop held on June 19-21, 2016 in Dagstuhl, Germany. The goal was to bring together researchers with
different areas of expertise relevant to ICN to discuss security and privacy issues
particular to ICN-based architectures. These problems have become increasingly
important as ICN technology gradually matures and gets close to real-world deployment.

\paragraph{Brief History of Dagstuhl Seminars on ICN}
This seminar is the fourth retreat of the ICN community at Schloss Dagstuhl, who
usually meet every two years at this place. In 2010, the term ICN was
coined to assemble different informa\-tion-centric networking approaches,
such as 4WARD, SAIL, PSIRP in Europe and content-centric networking (CCN) in the US.
In 2012, reality checks have been discussed. In 2014, special focus was on scalability
and deployment issues. This seminar discussed primarily security aspects.

\paragraph{Current Research Challenges}
Threat models in ICN are distinct from traditional IP-based networks ~\cite{wsv-bdpts-13,gtuz-ddndn-13}. Differentiating factors between the two include
new application design patterns, trust models and management, as well as a strong
emphasis on object-based, instead of channel-based, security. As ICN develops, it is both
timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues in order to devise and
assess possible mitigation techniques. This was the general purpose of the Dagstuhl
seminar. To that end, the seminar focused on the following issues:
%
\begin{compactitem}
\item What are the relevant threat models that ICN must be concerned? How are
they different from those in the IP-based networks?
\item To what extent is trust management a solved problem in ICN? Have we adequately
identified the core elements of a trust model, e.g., with NDN trust schemas?
\item How practical and realistic is object-based security when framed in the
context of accepted privacy measures used in the IP-based networks?
\item Are there any new types of cryptographic schemes or primitives that ICN architectures
could use to enable (a) more efficient or secure packet
processing or (b) a more security architecture?
\end{compactitem}
%
The seminar answered (entirely or partially) some of these questions and fueled discussions
for others. The major takeaways that resulted from these discussions are as follows.

\noindent
{\bf Management of namespace and identity}. The ICN community still does not have a clear answer on how to handle
namespace and identity management. While trust management in ICN can be distributed and function without a global PKI, it seems difficult to break away from this model for namespace management and arbitration. This has strong implications on how names are
propagated in the routing fabric. Can any producer application advertise any name,
anywhere in the network? If not, how can name prefix advertisements be constrained or limited? \\

\noindent
{\bf Forward secrecy}. Given that ICN focuses on object security, the need for transport
protocols that provide forward secrecy should be implemented in higher layers. Attendees
found that while most ICN-based architectures do not preclude forward secrecy, forward secrecy should
not be a requirement in the network layer.\\

\noindent
{\bf Locator and identifier split}. There is still a high uncertainty about whether ICN should split content
locator and identifier. Names in architectures such as NDN and CCN serve as both
locator and identifier of the data, though there are extensions that permit explicit locators
(e.g., through the use of NDN LINK objects). This distinction is necessary under the common understanding that
routing could be more efficient with topological names. Finding
data through non-topological names should not be implemented in the data plane as part of the global
routing space. However, if we revert to a distinction between topological locators and
identifiers, then the unique features of ICN become much more limited.
%One facet that is certainly unique to ICN is how software is written. Specifically, we have the opportunity to move beyond the mental model of a fixed address space and re-design existing network stacks and APIs. @@@ Edith: I don't quite understand the above sentences (commented). How does routing relate to software? @@@ \\

\noindent
{\bf Privacy tradeoffs}. Privacy seems difficult to achieve without major architectural changes to
ICN-based systems. In particular, since data names reveal large amount of information to
the passive eavesdropper, privacy demands that names and payloads have no correlation.
However, achieving this seems unfeasible without the presence of an upper-layer service
akin to the one that would resolve non-topological identifiers to topological names.\\

\noindent
{\bf How much crypto}. There are no compelling reasons to apply esoteric (and often untested)
cryptographic techniques in ICN, at least at the network layer. Computationally bounded
and traditional cryptographic primitives, such as elliptic curve digital signatures, hash functions, etc.,
could be the extent of per-packet cryptographic processing done by the routers.
%Anything more would become fodder for Denial-of-Service attacks that could render the entire infrastructure ineffective.
However, architecture designs should not restrict themselves
to specific algorithms. There should be flexibility in accommodating
multiple (and evolving) cryptographic primitives. This could be useful if, for example,
post-quantum digital signature schemes become necessary for the longevity of content authenticators.

The remainder of this workshop report is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:plenary-talks} summarizes plenary talks.
Section~\ref{sec:group-work} presents discussions during group work in detail.
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:open-problems} and Section~\ref{sec:outlook} discuss open problems and future work, respectively.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper described in detail the events and outcomes of the Dagstuhl 16251
seminar on ICN security and privacy. Despite significant research over the past
half decade, there are still many open problems with solutions that are difficult
to be completely realized with the existing architectures. Are we too invested in the current architectures to make significant design changes to solve these problems? Is there something to be gained by sacrificing properties such as privacy in favor of features such as object security? If so, is this the right tradeoff to make today? Only future research and development will tell.

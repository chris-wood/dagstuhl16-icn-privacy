\begin{abstract}
In recent years, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has received much attention from
both academic and industry participants. ICN offers data-centric inter-networking
that is radically different from today's host-based IP networks. Security and
privacy features on today's Internet were originally not present and have been
incrementally retrofitted over the last 35 years. As such, these issues
have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures towards
real-world deployment. Thus, while ICN-based architectures
(e.g., NDN, CCNx, etc.) are still evolving, it is both timely and important to explore
ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques.

This report documents the highlights and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 16251
on ``Information-centric Networking and Security.'' The goal of which was to bring together
researchers to discuss and address security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based
architectures. Upon finishing the three-day workshop, the outlook of ICN is still
unclear. Many unsolved and ill-addressed problems remain, such as namespace
and identity management, object security and forward secrecy, and privacy. Regardless
of the fate of ICN, one thing is certain: much more research and practical experience
with these systems is needed to make progress towards solving these arduous problems.

% Attendees represented diverse areas of expertise, including: networking,
% security, privacy, software engineering, and formal methods. Through presentations and
% focused working groups, attendees identified and discussed issues relevant to security
% and privacy, and charted paths for their mitigation and future work.

\section{Introduction}
Dagstuhl Seminar 16251 on ``Information-centric Networking and Security'' was a three-day
workshop held on June 19-21, 2016 in Dagstuhl, Germany. The goal was to bring together researchers with
different areas of expertise relevant to Information-Centric Networking (ICN) to discuss
security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based architectures. These problems have
become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures and gets close to real-world deployment.

\paragraph{Brief History of Dagstuhl Seminars on ICN}
This seminar is the fourth retreat of the ICN community at Schloss Dagstuhl, which
usually meets every two years at this place. In 2010, the term ICN was
coined to assemble different informa\-tion-centric networking approaches,
such as 4WARD, SAIL, PSIRP in Europe and Content-Centric Networking (CCN) in the US \cite{dagstuhl2010}.
In 2012, reality checks were discussed \cite{dagstuhl2012}. In 2014, special focus was given to scalability
and deployment issues \cite{dagstuhl2014}. And finally, at long last, the most
recent seminar discussed primarily security aspects of these architectures.

\paragraph{Current Research Challenges}
Many ICN-based architectures have the luxury of starting with a clean slate.
As a consequence, threat models in ICN are often distinct from traditional IP-based
networks ~\cite{wsv-bdpts-13,gtuz-ddndn-13}. Differentiating factors between the two include
new application design patterns, trust models and management, as well as a strong
emphasis on object-based, instead of channel-based, security. As ICN develops, it is both
timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues in order to devise and
assess possible mitigation techniques. This was the general purpose of the Dagstuhl
seminar. To that end, the seminar focused on the following issues:
%
\begin{compactitem}
\item What are the relevant threat models that ICN must be concerned? How are
they different from those in the IP-based networks?
\item To what extent is trust management a solved problem in ICN? Have we adequately
identified the core elements of a trust model, e.g., with NDN trust schemas?
\item How practical and realistic is object-based security when framed in the
context of accepted, best-practice privacy measures used in IP-based networks?
\item Are there any new types of cryptographic schemes or primitives that ICN architectures
could use to (a) enable more efficient or secure packet
processing or (b) build a more secure architecture?
\end{compactitem}
%
The seminar answered (entirely or partially) some of these questions and fueled discussions
for others. In the remainder of this document we will review the major themes of the
seminar, discuss many open problems that exist in ICN architectures, and summarize
their outlook going forward.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper described in detail the discussions and outcomes of the Dagstuhl 16251
seminar on ICN security and privacy. Despite significant research over the past
half decade, there are still many open problems with solutions that are difficult
to be completely realized with the existing architectures. Are we too invested in
the current architectures to make significant design changes to solve these problems?
Is there something to be gained by sacrificing properties such as privacy in favor
of features such as object security? If so, is this the right tradeoff to make today?
Only future research and development will tell.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
We thank Schloss Dagstuhl for providing a stimulating setting for this seminar. Much
progress was made over the course of the seminar and since its completion. This is mainly
because of the ease of face-to-face collaboration and interaction at Dagstuhl.

Section 2

The content is fine, but I'm not sure that having a structure that is divided between plenary talks and parallel work groups really makes sense.
You might want to simply structure the document on the basis of the topics addressed, independently of the workgroup/plenary issue

Section 3

Fine except 3.5 whose conclusion is a bit weak (group achieved a simple security model
and short paper will appear without any reference)

4.2 seems like an abstract of a talk, should be rewritten as a summary
Same for 4.4

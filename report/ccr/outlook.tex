\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:outlook}
After nearly a decade of research, there still exists a plethora of security
and privacy problems that the ICN community has yet to adequately address. 
This leaves much room for future work on a variety of topics, including, but
certainly not limited to:\\

\noindent
{\bf Object-based security with forward secrecy}. We need to resolve the 
    channel- vs object-based security debate. One primary factor why channel-based
    security is preferred is because it allows for forward secrecy. Without this,
    the security of a packet is entirely dependent on key management techniques.
    If private keys are leaked, then intercepted packets can be decrypted.
    Transport layer security adds another obstacle for attackers. If we can design an object-based security scheme that
    also provides forward secrecy, say built on the forward-secure public-key
    encryption scheme of Canetti et al. \cite{canetti2003forward}, then this argument is simplified.\\

\noindent
{\bf Namespaces, identities, and routing}. In ICNs, namespace ownership, identities, and
    the routing fabric are all intimately coupled. Currently, we do not know of a way
    to break away from a centralized model for namespace management and arbitration. 
    Routing updates therefore have a dependency on this management oracle. Otherwise,
    any producer application would be able to advertise any namespace it wants. Schemes
    such as \cite{dibenedetto2015mitigating} can be used to remove malicious producers
    from advertising under incorrect namespaces, but it \emph{does not} resolve conflicts
    over namespace ownership.

\noindent
{\bf Privacy}. Privacy of consumers, producers, and content all remain significant
    challenges in most ICN-based architectures. Moreover, the trend in the IETF and other
    standard bodies is to put privacy as a \emph{primary} goal going forward. Consequently,
    to meet future privacy expectations, many architectures need to make certain techniques
    such as onion-based routing \cite{uzun2011anonymous}, name encryption \cite{privacy}, or secure
    sessions \cite{wood-icnrg-ccnxkeyexchange-00} a de facto part of the architecture. 
    Otherwise, it is difficult to foresee the incentives to use these architectures in the
    real world.

Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header. The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software dependencies can be undesirable. Because the size of TCP options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange before application data may be transmitted. However, this cost can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous tcpcrypt connection.},

The CCNxKE protocol allows two peers to establish a shared, forward-secure key for secure and confidential communication. The protocol is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery between two peers. It is also designed to minimize the number of rounds required to establish a shared key. In the worst case, it requires two RTTs between a consumer and producer to establish a shared key. In the best case, one RTT is required before sending any application data. This document outlines how to derive the keys used to encrypt traffic for a session and shows how session information is exchanged between a consumer and producer using message encapsulation.},

  abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) raises data objects to first class routable entities in the network and changes the Internet paradigm from host-centric connectivity to data-oriented delivery. However, current approaches to content routing heavily rely on data-driven protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, threats to the stability and security of the content distribution system are analyzed in theory, simulations, and practical experiments. We derive relations between state resources and the performance of routers, and demonstrate how this coupling can be misused in practice. We further show how state-based forwarding tends to degrade by decorrelating resources. We identify intrinsic attack vectors present in current content-centric routing, as well as possibilities and limitations to mitigate them. Our overall findings suggest that major architectural refinements are required prior to global ICN deployment in the real world.},

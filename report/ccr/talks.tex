\section{Summary of Plenary Talks} \label{sec:plenary-talks}
The main seminar material was driven by plenary talks on a variety of topics
ranging, such as trust management, namespace management, privacy, and anonymity.
These talks began with a discussion of threat models and their importance in ICN.


In particular, recall that



Another major category of plenary talks focused on the future of ICNs. There are many infrastructure
security and privacy problems in IP-based networks that we could try to remedy.
Can ICNs use the NSEC3 strategy of \emph{authenticated denial} \cite{blacka2008dns} to limit incoming requests
for non-existent content as a way of deterring sophisticated distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks?
Can we levereage recent advances in deep packet inspection over encryption data \cite{sherry2015blindbox}
to let forwarders blindly route packets without seeing the content or sensitive information,
e.g., application names? Can we leverage information-theoretic PIR techniques \cite{pir-icn} to support
truly private content queries? Can we prevent correlation
of static content across multiple consumers by adopting randomizable encryption schemes \cite{blazy2011signatures}?
And if so, how can we do so while maintaining the integrity of content? There are many
features that could improve beyond what is done in IP-based networks and there are cryptographic
algorithms, schemes, and protocols that could allow us to realize these features. However,
it is unclear whether or not these more esoteric cryptographic schemes should be applied in
the network layer of a future Internet.

%%% Q: how to rope in PANINI, Project Origin, etc here?
